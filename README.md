## Installation
This code is developed and tested with Python 3.9. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for the installation. The requirements.txt file contains all necessary packages to run the code. To install the packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Generating Datasets
The main script for generating artificial datasets is:
```bash
python run.py
```

## Data Structure
- Generated datasets consist of multivariate time series and are intended for benchmarking unsupervised machine learning methods.
- Each dataset may contain a range of complexities (e.g., number of sensors, modes, noise level) and different types of injected anomalies (see Section 3.3 in the paper).


## Data Visualization

A Jupyter Notebook is provided in the Notebooks folder for basic exploration and visualization:

### Notebooks/Visualize_Datagen.ipynb
- This notebook allows you to load and plot generated datasets for inspection and quick analysis.
- Note: Some packages required for the notebook (e.g., matplotlib, jupyter, seaborn) are not included in requirements.txt and may need to be installed manually.

To use the notebook, run:
```bash
jupyter notebook Notebooks/Visualize_Datagen.ipynb
```

## Creating New Datasets
To create new datasets, you can use the `gen_parameters.py` file.
